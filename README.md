## General info
You can use encryption to send secret messages, but if you want to be even more subtle, you can hide them in plain sight: in an image. This kind of encryption is called steganography. The message will be hiding in a picture on some website, and only those who know will understand it. In this project I create a program for concealing a message within an image.

## Technologies
* Kotlin - version 1.5.20
* Gradle - version 7.0.2

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
